## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to collect certain stock information in the year 2017 and 2018 so Steve could tell his parents whether or not the stocks are worth investing. This process was originally completed with similar code, however, the goal for this round was to increase the efficiency (processing time) of the original code.

## Results

### Analysis
Here is the refactored code:

Here is the 2017 stock analysis with the execution time with the refactored code:

**Prior to the implementation of the refactored code, the processing time for the 2017 stock analysis was 1.24 seconds - that's a 78.58% decrease!

Here is the 2018 stock analysis with the execution time with the refactired code:

**Prior to the implementation of the refactored code, the processing time for the 2018 stock analysis was 1.19 seconds - that's a 80.67% decrease!

## Summary 

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
One key advantage to refactoring code is maintainability. After refactoring, the code is fresher, easier to understand or read, less complex and easier to maintain. Another key advantage is shortening the execution time of the code. After refactoring, the code is more concise, takes up less memory, and therefore performs more efficiently. One of the key disadvantages of code refactoring is time consumption - it takes forever! You may have no idea how much time it may take to complete the process. It may also land you into a situation where you have no idea where to go.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
In this particular scenario, I was able to reap the benefits of refactoring the VBA script without having to worry too much about the disadvantages. The code is now more concise, takes up less memory, and performes more efficiently. The refactoring was quick, simple, and relatively short, so I didn't have to worry about taking up too much time or getting lost in the code.
